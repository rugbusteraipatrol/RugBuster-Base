"""Say, in a sentence, what was found and what could not be established.

Written for Base; not shared with the other services. Same three fields,
own vocabulary.

`label` here mixes two independent readings. Rug risk is our claim about the
contract. Speculation risk is a reading of the pool on the day of the scan.
Where they disagree the sentence says which one moved, because a reader holding
only the label cannot tell -- that confusion is what made the Avalanche deploy
gate report a scanner regression when a bridged Chainlink token's pool drained.

And most of what keeps a token out of GOOD on this service is not a finding at
all: the live path never resolves a deployer, so its history is uncollected
rather than clean. Printing that as an unexplained warning invites the reader
to supply a reason we never gave them.
