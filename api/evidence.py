"""What the scanner claims, split into things that can each be checked.

Written for Base and deliberately not shared with the other services. The
dimensions carry the same names because the questions are the same; what fills
them is not. Copying field names between services is how `withhold_verdict`
came to blank a label on Avalanche while leaving every numeric verdict field
populated -- the code read correct and the vocabulary underneath it belonged to
another chain.

One rule throughout: a dimension we did not read reports UNKNOWN. UNKNOWN is
neither clean nor guilty, and it must never be collapsed into either. This
service reaches for it more than the others do, because its live path builds a
report from on-chain metadata and a DEX pair and never looks up a deployer at
all -- so `creator_history` is genuinely uncollected rather than empty.
