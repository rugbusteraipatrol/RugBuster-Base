"""Changing the local scoring rules must change the local engine version.

`cache_key` is version-scoped, so a cached verdict is only reused while the
versions in that key hold. Until now the key carried `DATA_CONTRACT_VERSION`
alone, which describes the *shape* of a response, not the rules that produce
the numbers in it. Editing `risk_engine.py` therefore changed the scores while
the key stayed identical, and the cache kept serving the previous rules'
verdicts for the rest of their window.

`LOCAL_ENGINE_VERSION` now sits in the key alongside it, and this file pins that
version against the contents of the file it describes.

The whole module is hashed rather than a list of functions. The Solana
equivalent started with a curated list and an independent review broke it in one
line: `rugcheck_to_risk` delegated to `_linear`, `_linear` was not on the list,
and changing it moved the verdict while the fingerprint stood still. A list only
covers what someone remembered; the risk is the change nobody thought about.

Cosmetic edits trip this too. That is the intended trade -- being asked "did
this change a score?" about a comment is cheap, and not being asked about a real
change is what this prevents.
