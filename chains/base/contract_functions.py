"""What a contract's bytecode says about its functions, and what it cannot.

Shared by the collector and the API, and deliberately free of dependencies:
the collector module imports psycopg2 and configures logging when it loads, and
the API must not inherit either to read four bytes.

NOT the same claim as on Avalanche, and the difference matters. There, the
published source is read and a power is only reported once its modifiers,
conditions and internal calls resolve. Here there is no explorer lookup --
Basescan needs an API key this deployment does not hold -- so nothing can be
established and a reading rests on the selector alone.

So nothing here scores. A matched selector is a *possible* power, and a
possible power is a question the scan did not answer: it is reported, it adds
no risk, and it keeps the answer from being called clean. `capability_check`
says which of those this reading is.

`powers` used to be an alias for `possible_powers`, kept because the scorer
read it. That alias is how a selector reached the verdict as an established
power, and it is gone: `powers` now carries only `source_read_powers`, which
is empty on this chain until source can be read.

Each selector says what the function *is*, not what its name resembles. The
previous matcher matched substrings of the human-readable name, and the names
lie in both directions -- burn(uint256) is the caller's own burn,
withdraw(uint256) is the unwrap on a wrapped native, paused() and
isBlacklisted(address) are view getters.

What this still cannot do: a selector is matched by searching the bytecode
for its bytes, so a coincidental byte sequence reads as a function. That is
one more reason a selector only ever makes a power possible.
