"""Base: what was found, what was read, and what was not.

This service reaches for UNKNOWN more than the others, and honestly so. Its
live path builds a report from on-chain metadata and a DEX pair; it never
resolves a deployer and never reads the contract's functions. So on a live scan
half the dimensions are genuinely uncollected -- and until now the response
said `GOOD` with no hint that half the checks had not run.

The rule the whole scanner keeps relearning: a dimension we did not read is
UNKNOWN, and UNKNOWN is neither clean nor guilty.
