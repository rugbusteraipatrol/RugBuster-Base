"""A function's name is not its behaviour -- Base.

The same matcher runs on all three EVM chains and had the same two false
positives here. Measured on this chain with real contracts:

    WETH   drain 20 -> 0    withdraw(uint256) is the unwrap.
    BRETT  backdoor -> none  owner() and a plain ERC-20 burn.
    USDC   upgrade 20     kept: it is a proxy, and the admin can
                          replace the implementation.

The table is a statement about EVM selectors, so it is identical to the
Avalanche one by intent rather than by accident; the tests are separate because
the collectors are.
