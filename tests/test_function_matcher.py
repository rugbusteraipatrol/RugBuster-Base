"""A function's name is not its behaviour -- Base.

The same matcher runs on all three EVM chains and had the same two false
positives here. Measured on this chain with real contracts:

    WETH   drain 20 -> 0    withdraw(uint256) is the unwrap: it burns the
                        caller's own wrapper and returns their own ETH.

The table is a statement about EVM selectors, so it is identical to the
Avalanche one by intent rather than by accident; the tests are separate because
the collectors are.

What changed after review: this chain cannot read source, so a matched selector
is a *possible* power and nothing more. The previous version of this file
pinned `powers` as an alias of `possible_powers` because the scorer read it --
which is how a selector reached the verdict as an established power. The alias
is gone and these tests now pin the opposite.
